🎨 UI/UX Strategy for MarketFusion
🧩 1. Global Design System (Foundation)

Before building dashboards, establish a Design System that ensures everything is consistent, scalable, and developer-friendly.

✅ Design Tokens

Colors: Define brand palette with accessible contrast

Primary: #0052CC (trust/professional)

Secondary: #00BFA5 (success/action)

Background: #F8FAFC

Neutral Grays: #1E293B, #64748B, #CBD5E1

Error/Warning: #DC2626, #FACC15

Typography:

Headings: Inter or Poppins (bold, modern)

Body: Nunito or Roboto (clean, legible)

Font scale: 12 / 14 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 32 px

Spacing: Use 8px grid system (8, 16, 24, 32, 48...)

Components Library:
Create reusable Blade + Tailwind components:

<x-table>

<x-alert>

<x-modal>

<x-badge>

🧠 Tip: Store all UI tokens (colors, shadows, radius, etc.) in /resources/css/theme.css for global theming.

## PENDING ITEMS (Not Critical)

### 5. ⚠️ Freelancer Wallet
**Status:** Routes and controller NOT created
**Impact:** Medium
**Recommendation:** Copy ClientWalletController structure for freelancers

**What's Needed:**
- Add routes to `routes/freelancer.php`
- Create `FreelancerWalletController`
- Create `resources/views/freelancer/wallet/` directory
- Create wallet index view

---

### 6. ⚠️ Vendor Wallet/Payout
**Status:** Routes and controller NOT created
**Impact:** Medium
**Recommendation:** Create VendorWalletController with withdrawal requests

**What's Needed:**
- Add routes to `routes/vendor.php`
- Create `VendorWalletController`
- Create withdrawal request system
- Add admin approval workflow
- Create `resources/views/vendor/wallet/` directory

---

### 7. ⚠️ Real-time Chat (WebSockets)
**Status:** Not implemented
**Impact:** Low (basic chat works)
**Recommendation:** Install later when needed

**Package Required:**
```bash
composer require beyondcode/laravel-websockets
npm install laravel-echo pusher-js
```

---

### 8. ⚠️ Settings Pages
**Status:** Menu links exist but point to `#`
**Impact:** Low
**Recommendation:** Connect to existing profile edit route or create dedicated settings

**Locations:**
- Client sidebar: line 52-55
- Freelancer sidebar
- Vendor sidebar

**Quick Fix:**
Update href from `#` to `route('profile.edit')`

---

### 9. ⚠️ Invoice System
**Status:** Not implemented
**Impact:** Low
**Recommendation:** Create later if needed

---

### 10. ⚠️ Job History
**Status:** Not implemented
**Impact:** Low
**Recommendation:** Add filter to jobs index with status=completed

## KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS

### 1. Chart Placeholders
**Location:** Earnings views
**Issue:** Charts show placeholder text
**Solution:** Install Chart.js or ApexCharts

```bash
npm install chart.js
# or
npm install apexcharts
```

### 2. Real-time Updates
**Location:** Job messages
**Issue:** Requires page refresh to see new messages
**Solution:** Install Laravel WebSockets

```bash
composer require beyondcode/laravel-websockets
```

### 3. Commission Rate Hardcoded
**Location:** `VendorOrderController@earnings()`
**Issue:** 15% commission is hardcoded
**Solution:** Move to settings table or category commission

### 4. No Wallet for Freelancers/Vendors
**Impact:** Can't withdraw earnings
**Solution:** Create wallet controllers (copy from ClientWalletController)

### 5. Settings Pages Not Connected
**Impact:** Low (can use profile edit)
**Solution:** Change menu href from `#` to `route('profile.edit')`

---

## QUICK FIXES FOR MENU ITEMS

### Fix Settings Links
**File:** `resources/views/layouts/client.blade.php` (line 52-55)

```blade
<!-- Change from: -->
<a href="#" class="menu-item">
    <i class="bi bi-gear"></i>
    <span>Settings</span>
</a>

<!-- To: -->
<a href="{{ route('profile.edit') }}" class="menu-item">
    <i class="bi bi-gear"></i>
    <span>Settings</span>
</a>
```

**Apply same fix to:**
- `resources/views/layouts/freelancer.blade.php`
- `resources/views/layouts/vendor.blade.php`

### Fix Job History Link
**File:** `resources/views/layouts/client.blade.php` (line 19-22)

```blade
<!-- Change from: -->
<a href="#" class="menu-item">
    <i class="bi bi-clock-history"></i>
    <span>Job History</span>
</a>

<!-- To: -->
<a href="{{ route('client.jobs.index', ['status' => 'completed']) }}" class="menu-item">
    <i class="bi bi-clock-history"></i>
    <span>Job History</span>
</a>
```

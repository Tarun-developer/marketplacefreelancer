## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Critical Bugs Fixed

#### Bug #1: Role Clearing on Dashboard Switch
**Problem**: Clicking "Enter as Client" deleted vendor and freelancer roles
**Cause**: Used `syncRoles()` which replaces all roles
**Fix**: Changed to `assignRole()` and added role ownership check
**Files**: `resources/views/dashboards/common.blade.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/SettingsController.php`

#### Bug #2: Dashboard Not Accessible After Refresh
**Problem**: After becoming a role, refreshing showed role selection again
**Cause**: `/dashboard` always showed common dashboard
**Fix**: Added auto-redirect based on `current_role` field
**Files**: `app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php`

#### Bug #3: Duplicate Role Switchers
**Problem**: Role switcher showing twice in navbar
**Cause**: Both header and role-switcher partial included
**Fix**: Removed duplicate from header.blade.php
**Files**: `resources/views/partials/header.blade.php`

#### Bug #4: Route Not Found Errors
**Problem**: `Route [switch-role] not defined`, `Route [profile.edit] not defined`
**Cause**: Missing routes and controllers
**Fix**: Created ProfileController, fixed route names
**Files**: `routes/web.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/ProfileController.php`

## 2. New Implementations

### 2.12 Multi-Role System & Onboarding (Implemented)
**Status**: Implemented in Version 3.0

**Concept**:
- **Single User, Multiple Roles**: Users can be assigned multiple roles (e.g., freelancer + client + vendor)
- **Dynamic Role Switching**: UI component to switch between roles and access corresponding dashboards
- **Role-Based Menus**: Sidebar and navigation adapt based on selected role
- **Unified Profile**: One account with multiple role capabilities
- **Onboarding Flow**: First-time users select their primary role with clear, visual options

**Implementation**:
1. **Onboarding Page**: `resources/views/auth/onboarding.blade.php`
   - Visual cards for each role type
   - Clear descriptions of what each role offers
   - AJAX role selection

2. **Controller Logic**: `app/Http/Controllers/SettingsController.php`
   - `showOnboarding()` - Display role selection
   - `setRole()` - Assign role and redirect to appropriate dashboard

3. **User Model**: Added `current_role` field for active role tracking

4. **Routes**: Added onboarding routes for role selection

**User Experience**:
- **First Login**: Users see onboarding page instead of default dashboard
- **Clear Choices**: "I want to hire freelancers", "I want to find jobs", "I want to sell products", "I want to do multiple things"
- **Immediate Redirect**: After selection, users go to role-specific dashboard
- **Role Switching**: Users can change roles later in settings

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **Database Changes**:
   - Users can have multiple roles via pivot table
   - Add `current_role` field to users table for active role

2. **UI Components**:
   - Role switcher dropdown in header
   - Dynamic sidebar based on selected role
   - Role-specific dashboard loading

3. **Controller Updates**:
   - Middleware to check current role
   - Role-based route access
   - Dashboard controllers for each role

4. **Benefits**:
   - **Flexibility**: Users can switch roles without logging out
   - **Clean UX**: Role-specific interfaces
   - **Scalability**: Easy to add new roles
   - **Business Logic**: Supports users who are both buyers and sellers

**Technical Requirements**:
- Update User model for multiple roles
- Create role switcher component
- Modify layout files for dynamic menus
- Update all controllers for role context
- Add role-based caching for performance

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `app/Models/User.php` - Add multi-role support
- `resources/views/partials/role-switcher.blade.php` - Role switching UI
- `resources/views/layouts/*.blade.php` - Dynamic menus
- `app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php` - Role-based dashboards
- `app/Http/Middleware/RoleMiddleware.php` - Enhanced for multi-role

**Example Usage**:
```php
// User has roles: freelancer, client
$user->assignRole(['freelancer', 'client']);

// In view, switch to freelancer dashboard
@if($currentRole === 'freelancer')
    @include('layouts.freelancer')
@elseif($currentRole === 'client')
    @include('layouts.client')
@endif
```

## Smart Layout Logic

The dashboard **adapts** to which roles you own:

### 1 Role (e.g., only Client):
- Shows 1 quick-access card
- Shows 2 stat cards (client stats)
- Shows 1 activity widget (client orders)
- Shows "Unlock More Features" prompt

### 2 Roles (e.g., Client + Freelancer):
- Shows 2 quick-access cards
- Shows 4 stat cards (2 client + 2 freelancer)
- Shows 2 activity widgets
- Shows "Unlock More Features" prompt

### 3 Roles (Client + Freelancer + Vendor):
- Shows 3 quick-access cards
- Shows 6 stat cards (2 per role)
- Shows 3 activity widgets
- No "Unlock More Features" prompt

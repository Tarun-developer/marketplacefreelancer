## Bug 1: "Enter as" Button Clearing User Roles

### Problem

When a user with multiple roles (e.g., vendor + freelancer) clicked "Enter as Client" on the common dashboard, ALL their existing roles were removed and only the client role remained.

**User Report**: "when I click on enter as client my roles get clear"

### Root Cause

The common dashboard (`resources/views/dashboards/common.blade.php`) was calling the wrong endpoint for users who already owned a role:

1. Button showed "Enter as Client" when user owned the client role
2. On click, JavaScript called `route("onboarding.set-role")` → `SettingsController@setRole`
3. The `setRole()` method used `syncRoles()` which **replaces all roles** instead of adding
4. Result: User's vendor and freelancer roles were deleted, only client remained

**Line 245 (before fix)**:
```javascript
// Send AJAX request to set role
fetch('{{ route("onboarding.set-role") }}', {  // ← WRONG ENDPOINT!
    method: 'POST',
    // ... calls setRole() which uses syncRoles()
})
```

**Lines 155-157 in SettingsController.php (before fix)**:
```php
// Assign single role
$user->syncRoles([$request->role]);  // ← DELETES OTHER ROLES!
```

### Solution

**Part 1: Fixed common.blade.php**

1. Added `data-has-role` attribute to buttons to track ownership
2. Created new `switchToRole()` function that calls `settings.switch-role` endpoint
3. Updated click handler to detect if user owns role and call switch instead of set

**Changes Made**:

```javascript
// Line 58: Added data-has-role attribute
<button data-has-role="{{ $hasRole ? '1' : '0' }}">

// Lines 227-231: Check if user owns role before action
if (hasRole && role !== 'multi') {
    switchToRole(role);  // Just switch view, don't modify roles
    return;
}

// Lines 243-264: New function to switch roles
function switchToRole(role) {
    fetch('{{ route("settings.switch-role") }}', {  // ← CORRECT ENDPOINT!
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ role: role })
    })
    // ... switches current_role only, preserves owned roles
}
```

**Part 2: Fixed SettingsController.php setRole() method**

Changed from `syncRoles()` (replaces) to `assignRole()` (adds):

```php
// Lines 155-159: Now adds role instead of replacing
if (!$user->hasRole($request->role)) {
    $user->assignRole($request->role);  // ← ADDS role, keeps others
}
$user->update(['current_role' => $request->role]);
```

## Bug 2: Role Dropdown Showing "Become" for Owned Roles

### Problem

After purchasing a role (e.g., vendor), the header dropdown still showed "Become Vendor" instead of recognizing the user owned it.

**User Report**: "I have become vendor but when I go back and click on client again in dashboard showing become vendor"

### Root Cause

This was actually a **caching issue**, not a logic bug. The header blade template (`partials.header.blade.php`) logic was correct:

```php
@if(in_array($role, $userRoles))
    "Switch to {{ $role }}"  // User owns it
@else
    "Become {{ $role }}"     // User doesn't own it
@endif
```

But cached views were not being updated after role purchase.

### Solution

1. Cleared view cache: `php artisan view:clear`
2. Cleared application cache: `php artisan cache:clear`
3. Added debug output to header for testing
4. User needs to hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)

## Bug 3: Dashboard Not Loading After Role Switch

### Problem

After purchasing both vendor and freelancer roles, clicking "Enter as Freelancer" or "Enter as Vendor" didn't show the dashboard.

**User Report**: "after when I buy both and refresh enter as vendor not working and enter as freelancer also not showing dashboard"

### Root Cause

This was caused by **Bug 1** - when user clicked "Enter as", their roles were being cleared by the `setRole()` endpoint, so they no longer had permission to access the dashboard.

### Solution

Fixed by Bug 1 solution - now "Enter as" calls `switchRole()` instead of `setRole()`, so roles are preserved and dashboard loads correctly.

## Files Modified

### 1. `resources/views/dashboards/common.blade.php`

**Changes**:
- Line 58: Added `data-has-role` attribute to role buttons
- Lines 227-231: Added role ownership check
- Lines 243-264: Added `switchToRole()` function

**Impact**: Users with owned roles now switch dashboards instead of reassigning roles

---

### 2. `app/Http/Controllers/SettingsController.php`

**Changes**:
- Lines 151: Changed `syncRoles()` to `assignRole()` for multi-role
- Lines 155-159: Changed `syncRoles()` to conditional `assignRole()`

**Impact**: Role assignment now adds roles instead of replacing them

---

### 3. `resources/views/partials/header.blade.php`

**Changes**:
- Lines 39-52: Added debug output (commented for local environment only)

**Impact**: Easier debugging of role issues

## Testing Checklist

### Scenario 1: User With No Roles

- [ ] User clicks "Become Client (Free)"
- [ ] Client role assigned
- [ ] Redirected to client dashboard
- [ ] User has 1 role: client

### Scenario 2: User Purchases Additional Role

- [ ] User (has client) clicks "Become Vendor ($15)"
- [ ] Redirected to checkout page
- [ ] Completes payment
- [ ] Vendor role assigned
- [ ] User has 2 roles: client, vendor
- [ ] Redirected to vendor dashboard

### Scenario 3: User Switches Between Owned Roles

- [ ] User (has client + vendor) goes to common dashboard
- [ ] Clicks "Enter as Client"
- [ ] Switched to client dashboard immediately
- [ ] User still has 2 roles: client, vendor
- [ ] Clicks "Enter as Vendor"
- [ ] Switched to vendor dashboard immediately
- [ ] User still has 2 roles: client, vendor

### Scenario 4: Multi-Role Assignment

- [ ] New user clicks "Enable Multi-Role Access (Free)"

- [ ] Current role set to client
- [ ] Can switch between all 3 dashboards
- [ ] All 3 roles remain after switching

## Key Concepts

### Role Ownership vs Current Role

| Field | Purpose | Changes When |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `roles` table (pivot) | Which roles user OWNS (permanent) | Only when purchasing new role |
| `current_role` field | Which dashboard to show (temporary) | Every time user switches view |

### Methods

| Method | Purpose | Effect on Roles |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `syncRoles()` | Replace all roles | DELETES existing, sets new |
| `assignRole()` | Add a role | KEEPS existing, adds new |
| `hasRole()` | Check if user owns role | No changes, just checks |
| `update(['current_role'])` | Change dashboard view | Only changes view, roles stay |

### Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `POST /onboarding/set-role` | Initial role assignment | Only during onboarding for new users |
| `POST /settings/switch-role` | Switch dashboard view | When user owns role and wants to change view |
| `GET /checkout/{role}` | Purchase new role | When user doesn't own role |
| `POST /checkout/{role}` | Process payment | After user completes checkout |

## Before vs After

### Before (Buggy Behavior)

```
User: John
Roles: vendor, freelancer, client
Current: vendor

1. Click "Enter as Client"
2. Calls setRole('client')
3. Executes: syncRoles(['client'])
4. Result:
   - Roles: client only  ❌
   - vendor and freelancer DELETED  ❌
5. Can no longer access vendor/freelancer dashboards  ❌
```

### After (Fixed Behavior)

```
User: John
Roles: vendor, freelancer, client
Current: vendor

1. Click "Enter as Client"
2. Calls switchToRole('client')
3. Executes: update(['current_role' => 'client'])
4. Result:
   - Roles: vendor, freelancer, client  ✓
   - All roles preserved  ✓
   - current_role: client  ✓
5. Can switch between all owned dashboards  ✓
```

## Prevention

To prevent similar bugs in the future:

### 1. Always Use Correct Methods

```php
// ❌ WRONG: Replaces all roles
$user->syncRoles(['client']);

// ✓ CORRECT: Adds role, keeps others
$user->assignRole('client');

// ✓ CORRECT: Remove specific role only
$user->removeRole('client');
```

### 2. Separate Endpoints

```php
// Onboarding (first-time setup)
POST /onboarding/set-role → Uses syncRoles() for initial setup

// Role switching (changing view)
POST /settings/switch-role → Only updates current_role field

// Role purchasing (adding new role)
POST /checkout/{role} → Uses assignRole() to add role
```

### 3. Always Check Ownership First

```php
// Before switching
if (!$user->hasRole($role)) {
    return error('You do not own this role');
}

// Before assigning
if ($user->hasRole($role)) {
    return error('You already own this role');
}
```

# Role Switching & Multi-Role System Update

## Date: 2025-10-13
## Feature: One-Time Role Purchase + Multi-Role Dashboard Switching

---

## Overview

Implemented a complete multi-role system where users can:
1. **Purchase roles once** (one-time payment, no recurring charges)
2. **Switch between dashboards** without changing their assigned roles
3. **Access multiple role dashboards** if they own multiple roles
4. **Beautiful role switcher UI** in the header of all dashboards

---

## ✅ Key Features Implemented

### 1. One-Time Role Purchase System

**Logic**:
- Users can purchase each role only ONCE
- Once purchased, the role is permanently assigned
- Attempting to purchase an already-owned role redirects to dashboard
- Free roles (cost = 0) are assigned immediately without payment

**Implementation** (`SettingsController.php::checkout`):
```php
public function checkout($role)
{
    $user = auth()->user();

    // Check if user already has this role (one-time purchase)
    if ($user->hasRole($role)) {
        return redirect()->route('dashboard')
            ->with('info', 'You already have this role. You can switch to it from the dashboard.');
    }

    // ... rest of checkout logic
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Prevents duplicate charges
- ✅ Clear user feedback
- ✅ No recurring subscription management needed
- ✅ Simple one-time payment flow

---

### 2. Multi-Role Dashboard Switching

**Concept**:
- User's `roles` table = All roles they OWN (never changes unless purchased)
- User's `current_role` field = Which dashboard they're viewing (changes frequently)
- Switching roles = Changing dashboard view, NOT purchasing new role

**Implementation** (`SettingsController.php::switchRole`):
```php
public function switchRole(Request $request)
{
    $user = auth()->user();

    // Check if user HAS this role before allowing switch
    if (!$user->hasRole($request->role)) {
        return response()->json([
            'success' => false,
            'error' => 'You do not have access to this role. Please purchase it first.'
        ], 403);
    }

    // Only update current_role (dashboard view), don't assign new role
    $user->update(['current_role' => $request->role]);

    // Redirect to appropriate dashboard
    return response()->json([
        'success' => true,
        'redirect' => route($request->role . '.dashboard')
    ]);
}
```

**User Flow**:
1. User purchases "Freelancer" role → Role added to `roles` table
2. User purchases "Client" role → Role added to `roles` table
3. User now has BOTH roles permanently
4. User clicks role switcher → Changes `current_role` to "freelancer" → Sees freelancer dashboard
5. User clicks role switcher again → Changes `current_role` to "client" → Sees client dashboard
6. Roles remain owned, only dashboard view changes

---

### 3. Beautiful Role Switcher Component

**File**: `resources/views/partials/role-switcher.blade.php`

**Features**:
- Only shows if user has multiple roles
- Color-coded role badges (client=primary, freelancer=success, vendor=info, admin=danger)
- Icon for each role (briefcase, shop, shield, etc.)
- Current role indicator with checkmark
- Dropdown menu with all owned roles
- Link to view all dashboards
- AJAX-based switching with loading state
- Smooth transitions

**Design**:
```
+---------------------------+
| 🎒 Freelancer ▾          |
+---------------------------+
| Switch Role              |
|---------------------------|
| 👤 Client                |
| 💼 Freelancer       ✓   |
| 🏪 Vendor                |
|---------------------------|
| 📊 View All Dashboards   |
+---------------------------+
```

**Location**: Top-right header of every dashboard layout

**JavaScript Functionality**:
- Sends POST request to `/settings/switch-role`
- Shows spinner during request
- Redirects to new dashboard on success
- Shows error alert if role not owned
- Disables button during transition

---

### 4. Enhanced Header Design

**Updated Layouts**:
- `resources/views/layouts/freelancer.blade.php`
- `resources/views/layouts/client.blade.php`
- `resources/views/layouts/vendor.blade.php`

**New Header Components**:
1. **Mobile Sidebar Toggle** - Left side, mobile only
2. **Page Title** - Dashboard name
3. **Role Switcher** - Multi-role dropdown (only if multiple roles)
4. **Theme Toggle** - Moon/Sun icon button
5. **User Dropdown** - Profile, Settings, Logout

**Header Layout**:
```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ☰  Freelancer Dashboard    |  🎒 Role ▾  🌙  👤 John Doe ▾          |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Responsive Behavior**:
- Mobile: Shows icons only, hides text
- Desktop: Shows icons + text labels
- All dropdowns right-aligned for better UX

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Routes Added

**File**: `routes/web.php`

```php
Route::middleware('auth')->group(function () {
    // Switch role (dashboard view only)
    Route::post('settings/switch-role', [SettingsController::class, 'switchRole'])
        ->name('settings.switch-role');

    // Purchase role (one-time)
    Route::get('checkout/{role}', [SettingsController::class, 'checkout'])
        ->name('checkout');

    Route::post('checkout/{role}', [SettingsController::class, 'processPayment'])
        ->name('checkout.process');
});
```

### Database Schema

**Users Table** (`current_role` column):
- Type: `string` (nullable)
- Purpose: Tracks which dashboard user is currently viewing
- Values: `client`, `freelancer`, `vendor`, `admin`, `super_admin`, `support`
- Updates: Every time user switches dashboards

**Role Pivot Table** (`model_has_roles`):
- Purpose: Tracks which roles user OWNS (purchased)
- Never changes unless user purchases new role
- Used for permission checks and role switcher display

3. Can only access client features
4. To get freelancer dashboard → Must purchase Freelancer role first

---

### Example 2: Multi-Role User

**User**: Sarah (has Client + Freelancer + Vendor roles)

1. Logs in → Sees last viewed dashboard (stored in `current_role`)
2. Header shows: **Role Switcher dropdown** with 3 options
3. Clicks "Freelancer" → Instantly switches to freelancer dashboard
4. Clicks "Vendor" → Instantly switches to vendor dashboard
5. Clicks "Client" → Instantly switches to client dashboard
6. All roles remain owned, just changing view

---

### Example 3: Role Purchase Flow

**User**: Mike (has Client role, wants Freelancer role)

1. On client dashboard → Clicks "Get Freelancer Role" button
2. Redirected to `/checkout/freelancer`
3. Sees price: $10.00 (one-time)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Role Purchase Tests
- [ ] Purchase client role (free) → Assigned immediately
- [ ] Purchase freelancer role → Goes to checkout
- [ ] Try to purchase same role again → Redirected with message
- [ ] Complete payment → Role assigned, redirected to dashboard
- [ ] Verify role in database (`model_has_roles` table)

### Role Switching Tests
- [ ] User with 1 role → No role switcher visible
- [ ] User with 2+ roles → Role switcher visible
- [ ] Click different role → Switches dashboard instantly
- [ ] Try to switch to unowned role → Error message
- [ ] Verify `current_role` updates in database
- [ ] Verify user permissions stay same

### UI/UX Tests
- [ ] Role switcher dropdown opens/closes smoothly
- [ ] Current role shows checkmark
- [ ] Role icons display correctly
- [ ] Colors match role types
- [ ] Loading spinner shows during switch
- [ ] Theme toggle changes icon

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
```php
// Cache user roles for 60 minutes
$userRoles = Cache::remember("user_{$userId}_roles", 3600, function() use ($user) {
    return $user->roles->pluck('name')->toArray();
});
```

### Database Queries
- Role switcher uses single query: `$user->roles->pluck('name')`
- No N+1 queries
- Eager loading in layouts
- Minimal database hits

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Permission Checks
```php
// Before allowing switch
if (!$user->hasRole($request->role)) {
    return response()->json(['error' => 'Access denied'], 403);
}
```

### CSRF Protection
- All POST requests protected with `@csrf` token
- AJAX requests include `X-CSRF-TOKEN` header

### Role Validation
- Role names validated: `required|in:client,freelancer,vendor,multi`
- Prevents invalid role assignment
- Database-level constraints enforced

---

## 📝 Code Quality

### Standards Followed
- ✅ Laravel best practices
- ✅ RESTful API conventions
- ✅ Bootstrap 5 class naming
- ✅ Blade templating standards
- ✅ JavaScript ES6 syntax
- ✅ Consistent indentation
- ✅ Clear variable naming
- ✅ Inline documentation

### Reusability
- Role switcher is a **partial component** → Can be included anywhere
- Consistent layout pattern across all role dashboards
- Shared JavaScript functions
- DRY principles applied

---

## 🎯 Business Logic Summary

### Key Principles

1. **One-Time Purchase**: Each role purchased once, owned forever
2. **Multi-Role Ownership**: Users can own multiple roles simultaneously
3. **Dashboard Switching**: Changing dashboards doesn't affect owned roles
4. **Permission Preservation**: Permissions stay consistent regardless of current dashboard
5. **Clear Separation**: Owned roles (permanent) vs Current role (temporary view)

### Real-World Analogy

Think of it like **Netflix profiles**:
- You subscribe once (purchase role)
- You can create multiple profiles (own multiple roles)
- Switching profiles doesn't cancel subscription (switching dashboards doesn't remove roles)
- Each profile sees different content (each role sees different dashboard)
- Subscription remains active (roles remain owned)
